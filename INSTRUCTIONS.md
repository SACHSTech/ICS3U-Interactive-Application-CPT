# ICS3U – Culminating Performance Task (CPT)
### Interactive Application using Java & Processing


## Overview

This Culminating Performance Task (CPT) is your opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the programming concepts covered in ICS3U by designing and building an **interactive application** using Java with the Processing library.

Your program does not have to be a game, although games are allowed. Any interactive program that allows a user to meaningfully interact with logic, visuals, and state is acceptable.

This is a major assessment and represents a significant portion of your final course grade.



## Learning Goals

Through this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- design and implement an interactive program
- apply programming concepts in meaningful ways
- structure and organize a non-trivial codebase
- explain and defend your design and implementation decisions


## Project Requirements

Your project must be an **interactive Processing sketch** written in Java and must clearly demonstrate effective use of the programming concepts learned in this course.

### Programming Concepts Expected

Your project should demonstrate **effective use** of the following concepts **somewhere in the codebase**:

- variables and data types  
- expressions and calculations  
- user input and interactivity (keyboard and/or mouse)  
- conditional logic  
- repetition (loops)  
- methods and decomposition  
- arrays and/or ArrayLists  

These concepts should be used **purposefully** and **appropriately** as part of your program’s logic. Adding features only to “check a box” is discouraged.



## Project Scope & Constraints

To keep projects comparable and manageable:

- You must use **Java with the Processing library**
- Your program must run from `src/Sketch.java`
- Do **not** use external libraries beyond Processing
- Your project should be understandable by someone reading your code for the first time
- Your application must include **meaningful user interaction**



## Group Work

You may complete this project:

- **individually**, or  
- **in a pair (maximum two students)**

If working in a pair:
- You are expected to work together using [pair programming](https://youtu.be/nWm79e9uH5k)
- Work should be committed to a **single shared repository**
- You will each be interviewed **individually** about the project

Do not use branches, pull requests, or advanced Git workflows.



## Repository Structure

Your repository is pre-configured with the following structure:

```
src/
  Sketch.java
README.md
INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

- All final code must reside in `Sketch.java`
- Any assets (images, sounds, etc.) must be included in the repository
- Your program must run correctly when opened and executed by the teacher



## Use of Graphic & Media Assets

Any graphic, audio, or other media assets used in your project must be **one of the following**:

- Original work created by you, or  
- Public domain, or  
- Creative Commons licensed (e.g. CC BY, CC BY-SA)

If you use assets that are **not your own**, you must:

- ensure the license allows reuse in a school project
- provide **proper attribution**

### Attribution Requirements

Attribution must appear in an appropriate section of your `README.md` file and include, where applicable:

- title or description of the asset
- creator/author
- source (link)
- license type (e.g. CC BY 4.0)

Failure to properly credit external assets may result in a deduction under professionalism or academic integrity.



## README.md

The `README.md` file currently links to this document.

Before submission, you must **replace its contents** with your own project README that includes:

- a screenshot of your program in action
- a brief description of your program
- how the user interacts with it
- any known limitations or incomplete features
- an attribution section for any external assets used


## Assessment Overview

This CPT is assessed in **two parts**:

- **Part A – GitHub Submission (50%)**
- **Part B – Technical Interview (50%)**

Full assessment criteria and rubrics for both components are provided in **[ASSESSMENT.md](ASSESSMENT.md)**.

You are strongly encouraged to review the assessment document before and during development.




## Academic Integrity

You may use:
- course notes
- previous assignments
- official documentation (Java / Processing)

You may **not** submit work that you do not understand or cannot explain.

During the technical interview, you will be expected to demonstrate familiarity with your own code. Work that cannot be explained may not receive full credit.



## Timeline

You will be given approximately 10 in-class periods to work on this project before and after the holiday break.

Regular progress is expected. Avoid leaving the majority of work until the final days.



## Final Notes

This project rewards:
- clear thinking
- good design decisions
- steady progress
- genuine understanding

Simple projects done well often outperform complex projects that are poorly understood.

If you have questions about scope or suitability of an idea, ask **before** investing significant time.
