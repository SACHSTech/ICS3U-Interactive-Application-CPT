# Technical Interview – ICS3U CPT

This document explains what to expect during the **technical interview** portion of the ICS3U Culminating Performance Task (CPT).

The purpose of the interview is to assess **your understanding and ownership of the work you submitted**.


## Purpose of the Interview

The technical interview is designed to:

- verify that you understand the code you submitted
- give you an opportunity to demonstrate your thinking
- assess your ability to reason about programming concepts in context

The interview is **not** meant to trick you or catch you out.  
It is meant to give you a fair opportunity to show what you know.

## Format

- Interviews will be conducted **in class**
- Length: approximately **10–15 minutes**
- You will have access to **your own code**
- Interviews are conducted **individually**, even for pair projects

The structure of the interview may vary from student to student.


## What Might Happen During the Interview

Depending on your project and the discussion, you may be asked to:

- walk through parts of your code
- explain how specific features work
- describe why you made certain design decisions
- identify or explain a bug or limitation
- respond to a hypothetical change or extension
- write or modify a small piece of code related to your project

Some interviews may focus more on **discussion and explanation**.  
Others may involve **live coding or reconstruction of a feature**.

Both approaches are valid.


## How Understanding Can Be Demonstrated

Understanding can be demonstrated in different ways, including:

- clear explanations using correct terminology
- accurately tracing logic or program flow
- modifying existing code
- rebuilding a simplified version of a feature
- adapting ideas to a new situation

You are **not expected to memorize code**, but you are expected to understand how it works.



## What You Should Prepare

Before your interview, you should be able to:

- explain the main features of your program
- describe how user interaction affects program behaviour
- identify where key concepts (loops, conditionals, methods, arrays) appear in your code
- discuss at least one limitation or improvement you would make

You do **not** need to prepare scripted answers.


## Important Notes

- The interview assesses **understanding**, not presentation skills
- You may take a moment to think before answering
- If you are unsure, explain your reasoning as best you can
- Honest partial understanding is better than memorized explanations


## Final Reminder

The goal of the interview is simple:

> **Show that this work represents your own understanding and effort.**

If you built the project yourself and understand how it works, the interview should feel like a conversation about your code.
