# Assessment – ICS3U Culminating Performance Task (CPT)

This document outlines how your CPT will be evaluated.  
Assessment is based on two complementary components that together measure both **what you built** and **what you understand**.


## Assessment Overview

The ICS3U CPT is worth **15% of your final course grade** and is assessed in **two equal parts**:

- **Part A – GitHub Submission (50%)**
- **Part B – Technical Interview (50%)**

Each part is evaluated separately and uses its own rubric.

# Part A – GitHub Submission Rubric (50%)

Your GitHub repository will be downloaded, run locally, and reviewed by the teacher.

## Technical Implementation & Concept Mastery (30%)

**Assesses how effectively and appropriately the required programming concepts are demonstrated throughout the project.**  
Concepts include variables, expressions, user input, conditionals, loops, methods, and arrays/ArrayLists.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Demonstrates **highly effective use of all required programming concepts**. Concepts are integrated naturally into the program’s logic and clearly support interactivity, behaviour, and state. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates **effective use of most required programming concepts**. Program logic works correctly, though some concepts may be simplified or underused. |
| **Level 2** | Demonstrates **partial or inconsistent use of required programming concepts**. Some concepts are missing, misapplied, or used only superficially. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates **minimal or ineffective use of required programming concepts**. Major gaps in understanding or implementation are evident. |


## Code Quality & Overall Design (10%)

**Assesses how clearly and thoughtfully the program is written and structured.**  
Focuses on readability, decomposition, naming, documentation, and adherence to the Java style guide.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Code is clean, well-organized, and easy to follow. Strong decomposition into methods, descriptive naming, minimal repetition, and clear documentation throughout. |
| **Level 3** | Code is mostly clear and well-structured. Methods and naming are generally appropriate, with minor issues in style or organization. |
| **Level 2** | Code is functional but inconsistently organized or difficult to follow. Repetition, weak naming, or limited documentation is evident. |
| **Level 1** | Code is poorly organized or hard to read. Little attention to structure, naming, or documentation. |



## Professionalism & Workflow (10%)

**Assesses work habits, documentation quality, and overall professionalism.**  
Includes commit history, README quality, and asset attribution where applicable.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Frequent, meaningful commits show steady progress over time. README is clear, complete, and professional, including proper asset attribution if applicable. |
| **Level 3** | Regular commits show progress. README is mostly complete and understandable, with minor omissions. |
| **Level 2** | Some commits are present but progress is uneven or unclear. README is brief, unclear, or missing key information. |
| **Level 1** | Few or no meaningful commits. README is missing, incomplete, or unprofessional. |

<br>

# Part B – Technical Interview Rubric (50%)

You will participate in a **10–15 minute in-class technical interview**.  
Evidence of understanding may be demonstrated through explanation, discussion, debugging, live coding, or reconstruction of program features.



## Code Familiarity & Ownership

**Assesses the extent to which the student demonstrates ownership of and familiarity with their own codebase.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Demonstrates clear ownership of the codebase. Navigates code confidently, explains functionality accurately, and can modify or extend existing code when prompted. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates general familiarity with the codebase. Can explain most features, with occasional hesitation or prompting. |
| **Level 2** | Demonstrates limited familiarity. Can identify some features but struggles to explain how they work. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates little to no familiarity with the codebase. Unable to explain or work with major portions of the program. |


## Conceptual Understanding

**Assesses the student’s understanding of programming concepts used in the project, demonstrated through explanation, application, or live coding.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Demonstrates strong understanding of concepts. Accurately explains or applies ideas using correct terminology and relevant examples from the code. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates solid understanding of most concepts, with minor gaps or imprecise explanations. |
| **Level 2** | Demonstrates partial understanding. Explanations or applications are simplistic, incomplete, or occasionally incorrect. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates minimal understanding of the concepts used in the project. |


## Reasoning, Adaptation & Reconstruction

**Assesses the student’s ability to reason about their program, adapt ideas, or reconstruct features in new or simplified contexts.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Reasoning is clear and flexible. Student can adapt logic, respond thoughtfully to hypotheticals, or recreate features through discussion or live coding. |
| **Level 3** | Reasoning is generally sound. Student can adapt or reconstruct ideas with some guidance. |
| **Level 2** | Reasoning is limited. Student struggles to adapt ideas beyond the original implementation. |
| **Level 1** | Unable to reason about, adapt, or reconstruct program logic. |


## Independence & Authenticity

**Assesses the degree to which the work appears to reflect the student’s own independent understanding and effort.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Demonstrates strong independence and authenticity. Shows fluency, confidence, and consistent understanding across explanations or coding tasks. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates general independence, with some reliance on memorized patterns or guidance. |
| **Level 2** | Demonstrates limited independence. Responses suggest surface-level familiarity rather than deep understanding. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates little evidence of independent understanding or authentic ownership of the work. |


## Final Notes

Professional judgment is used when applying all rubrics.  
Understanding may be demonstrated in different ways, and interview format may vary to best assess student learning.
