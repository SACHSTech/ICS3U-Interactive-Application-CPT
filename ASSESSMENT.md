# Assessment – ICS3U Culminating Performance Task (CPT)

This document outlines how your CPT will be evaluated.  

Assessment is based on two complementary components that together measure both **what you built** and **what you understand**.



## Assessment Overview

The ICS3U CPT is worth **15% of your final course grade** and is assessed in **two equal parts**:

- **Part A – GitHub Submission (50%)**
- **Part B – Technical Interview (50%)**

Each part is evaluated separately and uses its own rubric.



# Part A – GitHub Submission Rubric (50%)

Your GitHub repository will be downloaded, run locally, and reviewed by the teacher.



## Technical Implementation & Concept Mastery (30%)

**Assesses how effectively and appropriately the required programming concepts are demonstrated throughout the project.**  
Concepts include variables, expressions, user input, conditionals, loops, methods, and arrays/ArrayLists.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Demonstrates **highly effective use of all required programming concepts**. Concepts are integrated naturally into the program’s logic and clearly support interactivity, behaviour, and state. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates **effective use of most required programming concepts**. Program logic works correctly, though some concepts may be simplified or underused. |
| **Level 2** | Demonstrates **partial or inconsistent use of required programming concepts**. Some concepts are missing, misapplied, or used only superficially. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates **minimal or ineffective use of required programming concepts**. Major gaps in understanding or implementation are evident. |



## Code Quality & Overall Design (10%)

**Assesses how clearly and thoughtfully the program is written and structured.**  
Focuses on readability, decomposition, naming, documentation, and adherence to the Java style guide.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Code is clean, well-organized, and easy to follow. Strong decomposition into methods, descriptive naming, minimal repetition, and clear documentation throughout. |
| **Level 3** | Code is mostly clear and well-structured. Methods and naming are generally appropriate, with minor issues in style or organization. |
| **Level 2** | Code is functional but inconsistently organized or difficult to follow. Repetition, weak naming, or limited documentation is evident. |
| **Level 1** | Code is poorly organized or hard to read. Little attention to structure, naming, or documentation. |



## Professionalism & Workflow (10%)

**Assesses work habits, documentation quality, and overall professionalism.**  
Includes commit history, README quality, and asset attribution where applicable.

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Frequent, meaningful commits show steady progress over time. README is clear, complete, and professional, including proper asset attribution if applicable. |
| **Level 3** | Regular commits show progress. README is mostly complete and understandable, with minor omissions. |
| **Level 2** | Some commits are present but progress is uneven or unclear. README is brief, unclear, or missing key information. |
| **Level 1** | Few or no meaningful commits. README is missing, incomplete, or unprofessional. |



# Part B – Technical Interview Rubric (50%)

You will participate in a **10–15 minute in-class technical interview**.


## Code Familiarity

**Assesses how well you know and can navigate your own codebase.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Clearly and confidently explains how the program works and where features are implemented. |
| **Level 3** | Generally familiar with the codebase, with occasional uncertainty or prompting required. |
| **Level 2** | Limited familiarity with parts of the code; explanations are vague or incomplete. |
| **Level 1** | Unable to explain major portions of the codebase. |


## Conceptual Understanding

**Assesses understanding of programming concepts used in the project.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Explains concepts clearly and accurately, using correct terminology and examples from the code. |
| **Level 3** | Demonstrates solid understanding of most concepts, with minor gaps or imprecise explanations. |
| **Level 2** | Shows partial understanding; explanations are simplistic or occasionally incorrect. |
| **Level 1** | Demonstrates little understanding of the concepts used. |


## Design Reasoning

**Assesses ability to justify design decisions and discuss alternatives.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Clearly explains design choices and can reason about tradeoffs or improvements. |
| **Level 3** | Explains most design decisions but with limited depth or flexibility. |
| **Level 2** | Provides surface-level explanations with little justification. |
| **Level 1** | Unable to justify design decisions. |


## Transfer & Adaptability

**Assesses ability to apply understanding to new or hypothetical situations.**

| Level | Descriptor |
|------|------------|
| **Level 4** | Responds thoughtfully to hypotheticals and can adapt ideas or logic to new scenarios. |
| **Level 3** | Responds reasonably to hypotheticals with some guidance. |
| **Level 2** | Struggles to adapt ideas beyond the existing code. |
| **Level 1** | Unable to apply understanding beyond the original implementation. |


## Final Notes

Professional judgment is used when applying all rubrics.  
Clear understanding and honest ownership of your work are essential for success on this CPT.
